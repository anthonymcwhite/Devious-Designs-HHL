# The LilyGo T-Embed

<p>
  Flipper who?? The T-Embed might not be as pretty as the Flipper Zero, but the utility and potential speak for themselves. Currently in week 2 of testing (as of 8/21/2025). I discovered this device at DefCon33 and purchased it immediately when I returned from Las Vegas.     Although the T-Embed *can* be used right out of the box, flashing the device with "Bruce" firmware first would be my first recommendation to any new user/owner. Some of the first moddifications I made were related to external antenna's and the frequency range in which      the T-Embed's cc1101 chip operates at. This particular device can be modified to incorporate the nrf24 chipset, which will then allow the operator to take advantage of one of Bruce's modules which otherwise would be unavailable. The T-Embed has become one of my favorite    tools to carry and I will continue to expand on the capability and results from research & development.
