### The LilyGO T-Deck

<tt>The T-Deck is an interesting little device. It resembles the blackberry for those from a different era. However, although it has some practical utility in red teaming op's, compared to other hardware and devices, it has a limited range of funtion and capabilities. Initially I flashed Bruce to the device, which was incredibly simple and easy to use/navigate. Due to the limited options around tool functionality, I pretty quickly reverted it back to a Meshtastic device and is currently what I carry for access to the Meshtastic community.</tt>
