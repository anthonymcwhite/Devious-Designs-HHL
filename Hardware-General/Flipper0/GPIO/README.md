## Flipper Zero GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output) </br>
---

<tt>Listed in no particular order aside from that of my progression in testing, are the different features and modules that are used/accessed through the GPIO directory on the FZ.</tt></br>

### ESP32 Marauder </br>
<tt>Accessed via the GPIO directory, **only** after the ESP32-S2 WiFi Development board has been purchased and attached to the FZ. It is very much possible to build a DIY version of the commonly sold dev board with an esp32 chipset/board. The ESP32 Marauder is a well known tool in the info-sec community and has extensive documentation to support it.</tt></br>

### NRF24 </br>
<tt>The NRF24 is a module that can be purchased and attached to the FZ through the GPIO pins, unlocking an entire set of attacks & recon options</tt></br>
