# Maps for Meshtastic Nodes

Maps contained in this directory are created for devices capable of supporting Meshtastic firmware, but will not be connected to another device that provides maps or telemetry data. For example, the LilyGo T-Deck Plus.. looks like a blackberry style device, has many unique features, including a built in GPS and antenna.. BUT, it does not have any preinstalled/configured maps. First a micro SD card must be obtained, then you can take the maps you find here, create a folder on the SD card called "maps", and then drag and drop the map files onto the SD card (unzipped of course). After that, insert the SD card into the device and power up. You may be prompted to select which set of maps you would like to use if you have more than one configured. (i.e., Dark Matter vs OXED OSM). **NOTE** The Dark-Matter set of maps only allows for a very limited zoom level. Basically statewide and farther our, no roads, terrain, topo, anything like that. If you would like to access the better zoom levels, go for the OXED maps.
