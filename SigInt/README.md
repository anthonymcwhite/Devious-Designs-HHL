# Signals Intelligence
---

### SigInt; 
<tt>the discipline of collecting and analyzing intelligence derived from electronic signals and systems, such as communications (like phone calls and emails) and electronic emissions (like radar) from foreign targets, to understand their capabilities, actions, and intentions. It involves intercepting these signals, often without the sender's knowledge, and then analyzing them to extract useful information, sometimes involving cryptanalysis to decipher encrypted messages.</tt> </br>

### Purpose
<tt>The goal is to gain insight into adversaries' activities, capabilities, and intentions, enhancing situational awareness and decision-making for military and intelligence organizations. </tt>

### Key Components 
<tt> - COMINT (Communications Intelligence): Intelligence gathered from the interception of human communications, such as voice, text, or other signals.</tt></br> 
<tt> - ELINT (Electronic Intelligence): Intelligence gathered from the interception of electronic signals not directly used in communication, such as radar and telemetry.</tt></br> 
<tt> - FISINT (Foreign Instrumentation Signals Intelligence): Intelligence derived from the instrumentation and telemetry of foreign systems, such as foreign weapons systems. </tt></br>

### Process
<tt> - Interception: Capturing signals not intended for the interceptor.</tt></br> 
<tt> - Analysis: Examining the collected signals to identify patterns and extract meaning.</tt></br> 
<tt> - Integration: Combining findings with other intelligence sources, sometimes including cryptanalysis to break codes.</tt></br>
