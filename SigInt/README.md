# Signals Intelligence
---

### SigInt; 
<tt>the discipline of collecting and analyzing intelligence derived from electronic signals and systems, such as communications (like phone calls and emails) and electronic emissions (like radar) from foreign targets, to understand their capabilities, actions, and intentions. It involves intercepting these signals, often without the sender's knowledge, and then analyzing them to extract useful information, sometimes involving cryptanalysis to decipher encrypted messages.</tt> </br>

### Purpose
<tt>The goal is to gain insight into adversaries' activities, capabilities, and intentions, enhancing situational awareness and decision-making for military and intelligence organizations. </tt>

### Key Components 
<tt> - COMINT (Communications Intelligence): Intelligence gathered from the interception of human communications, such as voice, text, or other signals.</tt></br> 
<tt> - ELINT (Electronic Intelligence): Intelligence gathered from the interception of electronic signals not directly used in communication, such as radar and telemetry.</tt></br> 
<tt> - FISINT (Foreign Instrumentation Signals Intelligence): Intelligence derived from the instrumentation and telemetry of foreign systems, such as foreign weapons systems. </tt></br>

### Process
<tt> - Interception: Capturing signals not intended for the interceptor.</tt></br> 
<tt> - Analysis: Examining the collected signals to identify patterns and extract meaning.</tt></br> 
<tt> - Integration: Combining findings with other intelligence sources, sometimes including cryptanalysis to break codes.</tt></br>

## Specialized Hardware, Software, Technique & Tools for SigInt

### Operating Systems
<tt> [1] Dragon OS </tt></br>
[Download DragonOS](https://sourceforge.net/projects/dragonos-focal/files/latest/download)
<p><tt>
Dragon OS is a Debian-based Linux distribution pre-loaded with software-defined radio (SDR) tools and drivers, simplifying the setup for enthusiasts by providing a ready-to-use environment for exploring radio frequencies, tracking satellites, decoding digital modes, and more. It supports various SDR hardware like the RTL-SDR, HackRF One, and LimeSDR, allowing users to experiment with applications such as WSJT-X for weak-signal communication, GPredict for satellite tracking, and SDR Angel for decoding aircraft ADS-B signals. Dragon OS offers ease of use by functioning as a live bootable OS for testing or can be installed alongside an existing operating system.

<tt> [2] SIGINT OS </tt></br>
[Download SigIntOS](https://www.sigintos.com/download/)
<p><tt>
 Linux distribution explicitly designed for signals intelligence (SIGINT). An operating system (OS) handles SIGINT, which is a software signal, asynchronously, meaning the OS sends it to a process to interrupt its normal flow and perform a specific action.

<tt> [3] Kali Linux </tt></br>
[Download Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-platforms)
<p><tt>
 Debian based, universal Linux operating system that can be used for many aspects of Signals Intelligence. NOT for beginners or the faint of heart. Pack a lunch.
